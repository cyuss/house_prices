# Introduction

	This project aims to get familiar with all the steps taken to solve a Machine Learning problem. It shows the different steps from **data exploration** to **prediction** and trying to identify some reproductible patterns that could be used in similar projects.

​	For that we choose a basic Kaggle challenge about **House Prices Prediction** (see [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)).



# Context

​	Giving a dataset ([download](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)) about prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, we try to predict the final price of each home. We also try to find which variables and factors influence the prices and create new features to better understand the problem and get better results. Each data input is described with 79 explanatory variables like the type of road access, neighberhood, type of heating... etc. Which of these variables have more impact on prices?

# Workflow

​	In this project, we tried to create a directory template that suits each step of our workflow. For an easy access to each step, we organized the files in different directories. **data/** directory for the original, added and proccessed data, **notebooks** directory that contains the differet jupyter notebooks used here for *data exploration* and *data processing*.
